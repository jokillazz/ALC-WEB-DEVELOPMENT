                    Bob is an insane pumpkin produce grower. He considers it his one and only talent. Bob is very good at raising his fruit and vegatbles and they come second to no one. Seeing his pumpkin children being adopted brings him joy. It is reccomended that when you buy a pumpkin from Bob you don't carve them...Bob is very protective of his produce. </p>
