                <p id="p-home">If your wanting produce to adopt then Crazy Bob's Pumpkin patch is the place for you! We range anywhere from Squash to pumpkins and that's about it. As long as you come pick out a pumpkin or squash and promise Bob you take good care of the produce it's yours with a small 5$ fee. Bob understands they don't live long but recommends to take good car of his produce. It is highly recommended you never take a knife to one of Bob's produce. Bob is not kind to those that mistreat his pumpkin and squash children. So feel free to come and take a look around and adopt a small or big pumpkin or squash child today! </p>
